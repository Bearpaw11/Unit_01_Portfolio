# Unit_01_Portfolio

This is a Portfolio page that took me about 20 hours to make. 

It consisits of HTML and CSS

This is a starting point for a resource I will use to help get a job once I finish this bootcamp

The strugles were trying to get things to look the same and stay in the same realtive place once the window gets larger or smaller. Hopefully I will learn more about how to do this as I progress in this bootcamp.
