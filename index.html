     <p>Hi, that's me Chris. Great hair yah? Friends call me Bearpaw (I have huge hands) and a few other choice names haha. To make our first in person introduction a little easier No, I didn't play basketball (I'm 6'6) but I was a golf pro for about 6 years and no, I never met Tiger Woods. I was born and raised here the valley and have lived in Gilbert since 1996. I have a great wife and the cutest 1 year old daughter who I would post a picture of here if it was appropriate. I spend most of my free time finding slides for my daughter to go down, playing poker or playing golf.</p>
    <p> About me professionally, I am a Full Stack Web Developer who is a critical thinker, team player and loves a challenge. Recently received a Full Stack Development certificate from The University of Arizona. I have built this portfolio that showcases my skills with front end programs such as HTML5, JavaScript, Bootstrap, ReactJs and back end programs such as Node.js, Java and MySQL. My experience as a Systems Engineer has given me knowledge of the cutting edge hardware and software being used to accelerate growth and new technologies in this space. I also have a strong business background that includes a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Finance that can be used to put a monetary perspective on projects as well. I am excited to leverage my expertise, education and knowledge and become an asset to a software development team.</p>
